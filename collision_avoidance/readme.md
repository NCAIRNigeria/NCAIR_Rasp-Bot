# Collision Avoidance Mode

Welcome to the Collision Avoidance mode of the NCAIR_Rasp-Bot project! In this mode, the Raspbot robot utilizes sensors and algorithms to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.

## Description

In this mode, the Raspbot robot is programmed to navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles. The collision avoidance algorithm helps the robot identify potential obstacles in its path and make decisions to change its direction to avoid collisions.

## Getting Started

To use the Collision Avoidance mode, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have set up your Raspbot hardware and environment as described in the main README.
2. Open the `collision_avoidance` directory.
3. Run the `collision_avoidance.py` script to start the robot in collision avoidance mode.

## Data Collection

To improve the collision avoidance algorithm, you can also contribute by collecting data. The `data_collection.ipynb` notebook provides a guide to record sensor readings and obstacle scenarios for further analysis and enhancement of the algorithm.

## Usage

While the robot is running in collision avoidance mode, it will autonomously navigate the environment, detect obstacles, and make appropriate movements to avoid collisions.

## Contributions

Contributions to this mode are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the collision avoidance algorithm, enhancing sensor integration, or anything else related to this mode, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## License

This mode is distributed under the [MIT License](../LICENSE). Feel free to modify and use it for your own projects.

Happy exploring with the Collision Avoidance mode of NCAIR_Rasp-Bot!
